By: SRINIDHI A

Features Implemented:
- Four semantic HTML pages: Home, Gallery, About, and Contact
- Responsive navigation bar using Flexbox
- Animated "Open House!" banner with CSS keyframes
- Gallery grid (2x2) with 4 placeholder images, titles, descriptions, and alt text
- Hero section with featured artwork in the Home page
- Modern About page with floated image, cards for content, and stylish staff/artist lists
- About page includes notable artists, exhibition timeline (ordered list), and external link
- Contact page features address, phone, email, and a highlighted table for studio hours
- Video gallery tour using online or embedded video
- Extensive CSS: modern cards, accent colors, custom list bullets, borders, box-shadow, and hover/transition effects
- Use of named color, HEX, RGB, and HSL in different parts of the site
- Responsive display for small screens (stacking/floating behavior)

Known Issues:
- The site is not fully responsive on very small mobile devices; some text and images may appear too small or squished.
- Navigation menu does not collapse into a hamburger menu on phones or narrow screens.
- Placeholder images and videos are used instead of actual gallery content, which may lessen visual impact.
- Video playback depends on external sources or placeholder links and may not always load if the source is unavailable.
- Some CSS hover and animation effects may not work consistently on all browsers.
- The "Virtual Gallery Tour" external link uses a dummy URL and does not lead to a real tour.
- Minor spacing and alignment inconsistencies in the About page on certain screen sizes.
- No form validation or interactive contact features are implemented on the Contact page.
- No custom error handling for broken image or video links.

Browsers Tested:
- Google Chrome (latest)
- Mozilla Firefox (latest)

Instructions:
- Open `index.html` in your web browser to browse the site.
- All images and video use online placeholders; replace with your own for personalization.
